<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div style="margin:0;padding-left:10px">
<p>The categories are <b>tags</b> the users can attach to a ticket. These categories are used to group tickets or to generate statistics on a specific subset of tickets. The categories a user can attach are free. Nevertheless, if a list of categories is defined, the system will present these <b>proposed categories</b> in a drop-down list.</p>
<p>The list of these proposed categories can be defined by the Administrator, by section (and by language). The lists are simple <b>csv</b> files stored in the /upload/ directory.</p>
</div>

<h2>CSV file</h2>

<div style="margin:0;padding-left:10px">
<p>The list of categories is a simple text file with comma separated values (where ; is the separator).<br />
The file contains per row: one tag and, optionally, a short description.</p>
